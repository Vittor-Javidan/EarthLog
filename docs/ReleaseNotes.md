# [1,2] Docx export with images

- Now docx files are exported much faster, with images included
- Now explore files shows every file inside folders, but only folders, images and json files still openable.
  - New Icon added to represent other files
- Docx class fully rewritten
- Docx files are build inside the app, with no third partie libraries. But Zip still need third parties.
