# [1,2] Camera Picture Preview

- Now it has its own layer
  - Vertical pictures preview on production was just showing in half. After a day debugging without succes, i just create a new and better implementation, that can allow image editing in the future.
  - The bug was more likely cause by the lib, and not the code I had wrote
- Now picture previews show the whole picture, instead of a cop of the camera dimension.
