# 0.1.6.3 File exporting ajustments

- Instead creating a scope and screed to see exported files, now the app just delete the created files after sharing. (makes no sense to store this files if they can be saved on other clouds services like one drive, google drive, phone storage, etc). Building files are fast and easy enough to not have this necessity.
