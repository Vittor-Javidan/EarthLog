# Known bugs (From High to Low Priority)

- Layout Title being too small in some devices
- Icon from delete button slider cancel button being outside the button in some devices
- Screen buttons from ProjectScope and Sample Scope not working functioning in the first seconds after render (Some kind of delay is happening where the component has the click feedback, but the functionality does not trigger in these first seconds)
