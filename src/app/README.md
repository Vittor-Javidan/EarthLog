# App Folder Architecture (13 September 2023)

- This folder is used only to define Scope, where components like <Layout.Root /> and <Layout.Carousel.Root /> are declared.
- <Layout.Root /> is responsable to render the base layout (navbar, backpress action, navigation tree, drawer, etc).
- <Layout.Carousel.Root /> is responsable to allow multiple screen to exist side by side inside the same scope.
